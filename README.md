- Don't know about you but when i was the DE guy, i used to use the gestures of touchpad.
- So i figure out how to enable some gestures for tilling-wm.
- **STEPS TO CONFIGURE**:
    + Goto `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/`, create if you don't have these folders. 
    + Then create `90-touchpad.conf` and paste the content from my repository's file.
